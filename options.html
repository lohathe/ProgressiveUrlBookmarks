        <h1>Configure your PUB!</h1>
        <p><strong>PUB</strong> (Progressive Urls Bookmarker) is a nice tool, but it needs some settings in order to work properly, to satisfy <em>your</em> needs.</p>

        <h2>PUB bookmark folder</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <p>PUB needs a dedicated bookmarks folder where he can store and manage the bookmarks as he pleases. This way neither you nor PUB have to worry about consequences about your (other) precisous bookmarks!</p>
            <p>The default folder is <em>PUB_playground</em>, but if you want to rename it, or you want PUB to use an already existing folder, then please do so!</p>
            <p>[COMING SOON] If you already have a bookmark folder full of your "progressing urls" but you do not want to give it to PUB, then you can tell PUB to import it!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="current-setting">
            <p>You are currently using folder: <strong id="the-folder"></strong></p>
        </div>
        <form id="PUB_bookmarks_folder_selector">
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Bookmark folder</legend>
                <label>Name:</label>
                <input type="text" id="PUB_bookmarks_folder">

        <h2>PUB matching rules</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <p>The core feature of PUB is to automatically manage progressing urls. But only <em>you</em> know which urls are to be tracked, and it is <em>you</em> who must tell PUB how to recognize the title and the progressing number from a url. How can you teach PUB? PUB is a lawful-good and low-intelligence creature: he follows <em>your</em> rules and he speaks a very simple language. And the more precise you are, the more useful PUB becomes!</p>
            <p>[COMING SOON] If you can supply a rule without the wildcard <em>*</em> then PUB can try to translate a progressing url into the given rule (thus he can try open a content into another site)!</p>
            <p>[COMING SOON] You must specify rules telling PUB how the sites you are using format their "progressing url" content. PUB wants to know how to extract the <em>title</em> and <em>episode</em> from an url. An example rule can be: <em>*://my.content.site/*/watch/&lt;title&gt;/episodes/ep-&lt;episode&gt;</em>. You can use the following constraints to express a rule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>`*`</em> is a wildcard and matches every character except `/`</li>
                <li><em>`&lt;title&gt;`</em> is the placeholder for the content's title. Note that it cannot be directly preceded of followed by `*`. It matches every character except `/`.</li>
                <li><em>`&lt;episode&gt;`</em> is the placeholder for the content's progression number. Note that it cannot be directly preceded of followed by `*`. It matches every character except `/`.</li>
                <li>any explicit character represents an exact match. `/` characters are extremely important since they are used as delimiters.</li>
                <li>the end of the rule is <em>not</em> strict. This means that PUB will try its best to match as much as possible, and if the start of a url matches a rule but the url is longer, then the exceding part of the url is ignored.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="current-setting">
            <p>You are currently using these rules:</p>
            <ul id="current-rules">
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>PUB suggestions</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <p>You don't remember what you last saw/read? You don't want to open the history/bookmarks to reach <em>your last</em> content? PUB is willing to show you a list of recently bookmarked content.</p>
            <p>[COMING SOON] But we all know that if the list is too long or too short then it has little value: you can decide how long this list must be! The default length is <em>5</em>.</p>
